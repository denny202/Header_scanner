owasp_sec_headers = {'X-Frame-Options':'The X-Frame-Options HTTP response header can be used to indicate whether or not a browser should be allowed to render a page in a <frame>, <iframe>, <embed> or <object>. Sites can use this to avoid clickjacking attacks, by ensuring that their content is not embedded into other sites.','X-XSS-Protection':'The HTTP X-XSS-Protection response header is a feature of Internet Explorer, Chrome, and Safari that stops pages from loading when they detect reflected cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks.','X-Content-Type-Options':'The X-Content-Type-Options response HTTP header is used by the server to indicate to the browsers that the MIME types advertised in the Content-Type headers should be followed and not guessed.This header is used to block browsers MIME type sniffing, which can transform non-executable MIME types into executable MIME types (MIME Confusion Attacks).','Referrer-Policy':'The Referrer-Policy HTTP header controls how much referrer information (sent via the Referer header) should be included with requests.','Referrer-Policy':'The Referrer-Policy HTTP header controls how much referrer information (sent via the Referer header) should be included with requests.','Content-Type':'The Content-Type representation header is used to indicate the original media type of the resource (before any content encoding is applied for sending). If not set correctly, the resource (e.g. an image) may be interpreted as HTML, making XSS vulnerabilities possible.','Strict-Transport-Security':'The HTTP Strict-Transport-Security response header (often abbreviated as HSTS) lets a website tell browsers that it should only be accessed using HTTPS, instead of using HTTP.','Cross-Origin-Resource-Policy ':'The HTTP Cross-Origin-Opener-Policy (COOP) response header allows you to ensure a top-level document does not share a browsing context group with cross-origin documents. This header works together with Cross-Origin-Embedder-Policy (COEP) and Cross-Origin-Resource-Policy (CORP) explained below. This mechanism protects against attacks like Spectre which can cross the security boundary established by Same Origin Policy (SOP) for resources in the same browsing context group. As this headers are very related to browsers, it may not make sense to be applied to REST APIs or clients that are not browsers.','Permissions-Policy':'Permissions-Policy allows you to control which origins can use which browser features, both in the top-level page and in embedded frames. For every feature controlled by Feature Policy, the feature is only enabled in the current document or frame if its origin matches the allowed list of origins. This means that you can configure your site to never allow the camera or microphone to be activated. This prevents that an injection, for example an XSS, enables the camera, the microphone, or other browser feature.'}
